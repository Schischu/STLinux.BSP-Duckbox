          configuration for an embedded Linux project. A project constists
          of one directory in $(PROJECTDIR), which is usually to be found
          in $(PTXDIST_TOPDIR)/projects when being delivered with the
          PTXdist base package.

          You can specifiy an additional directory which is being searched
          for "local" projects with "make setup". The predefined path
          for local projects is $(PTXDIST_TOPDIR)/local_projects.

          type "make configs".
